# Sentiment-Analysis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early on in 2020, the onset of COVID-19 shuttered movie theatres and forced people to stay in their homes. Because of this, streaming platforms like Netflix saw a surge in demand as people searched for entertainment in new places. This boost led to huge audiences for their own hit productions where 64 million subscribers watched Tiger King, 30 million watched reality-TV show Love is Blind, and 85 million watched the original movie Spenser Confidential. There’s no doubt that Netflix has been helped by these viral sensations, but the challenge Netflix now faces is how do they grow their business while preventing subscriber churn when production studios are closed for the foreseeable future.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on this understanding, we wanted to see how well Netflix’s Original Productions fared based on data we collected on critical reception. We then wanted to compare this to popular Twitter sentiment for these original productions to understand what kinds of productions are faring well with the public, giving us the ability to provide Netflix with some recommendations. In the streaming world, where content is king, this analysis can help Netflix better understand what specific productions to invest in, what new productions to develop based on what the people want, and when they should release these original productions.
